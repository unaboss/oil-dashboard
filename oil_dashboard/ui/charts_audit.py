        **What is the Signal Audit?**

        This tab checks how good the confluence score actually is at predicting price moves. Think of it as a "report card" for the dashboard's signals. It looks at every day where the score was 2 or higher (bullish) or -2 or lower (bearish), then checks what WTI actually did over the next 3 trading days.

        **The Gauge:**
        - Shows the **hit rate** — what percentage of signals called the direction correctly.
        - 70%+ = excellent. 50-70% = useful. Below 50% = signals are no better than a coin flip, be cautious.

        **Confirmed tab:**
        - Best examples where the signal was RIGHT. A bullish score + price went up 3%+ = confirmed.
        - These are what you want to see — the dashboard doing its job.

        **Missed tab:**
        - Big price moves that the dashboard did NOT signal. Price moved 3%+ but the confluence score was below 2.
        - These are usually caused by sudden news — geopolitics, surprise OPEC announcements, etc. The dashboard can't predict those.

        **False Signals tab:**
        - The dashboard said "bullish" but price went down, or said "bearish" but price went up.
        - Every system has false signals. The goal is to have more confirmed than false.

        **How to use the audit:**
        1. Check the hit rate regularly. If it drops below 50% for weeks, the market may be in a news-driven phase where fundamentals matter less.
        2. When you see a confluence signal today, look back at the audit. Are signals working right now, or is the market ignoring fundamentals?
        3. Don't trade every signal — only trade when the audit shows the dashboard is "in sync" with the market.
